# Hover Glow
#### A hover glow effect is a transition effect that happens when a user hovers over an element on a website using a pointing device, like a mouse pointer. It can be used to highlight important items on a page and improve the user experience. Here are some ways to create a hover glow effect:
#### Use HTML and CSS - Wrap an image in a container div and apply a box-shadow property with a green-yellow color.
#### Use two layers of HTML- Duplicate a layer of HTML and hide it, then place the duplicate directly on top. Mask the top layer so that only part of it is visible at a time. As the pointer moves, the mask moves with it, making it look like the glowing is happening wherever the pointer is.
